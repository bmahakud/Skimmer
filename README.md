Step1. Edit the InputDetails.dat file according to your need

Step2. Execute the following command to create a ClassReadTree.cc using which you will read the Ntuple.The command is below
```
./Main.sh InputROOTfile.root  TreeMaker2/PreSelection
```
In the above command "TreeMaker2" is the directory name inside the root file and "PreSelection" is the Tree name.If you do not have any directory inside root file ..then give only the Tree name

```
root -l MasterReader.C
